# Overview of Project Functionality
This project lays the barebones foundation of the spreadsheet structure. The nested Cell class 
contains a String name and object to hold data. This data can now be computed to its proper value
and can be then used in other cells. Supports Saving and Loading from XML files.

# Comments to Evaluators:
This Assignment got very convuluted very quickly and it was somewhat difficult for me 
to keep track of everything that was changed. I believe I made the necessary edits to every 
part of my program, but navigating up and down my code became tedious near the end.

# Assignment Specific
I predicted to spend 8 hours on this assignment. I spent about 12 hours total. This assignment
got very time consuming in terms of just piecing together all of the slight changes.
