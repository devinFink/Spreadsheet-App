# Overview of Project Functionality
This is the testing document for the Formula Project. I got to 97% code coverage overall.

# Comments to Evaluators:
N/A.

# Assignment Specific
I predicted to spend 10 hours on this assignment. I spent about 12 hours total. About 3 of those hours were simply 
contemplating the instructions and setting up the files, because I was so confused. After that I spent about 
2 hours building and testing the constructor and syntax checker, and the remainder making sure evaluate works
and testing (very) thouroughly.
