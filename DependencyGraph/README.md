# Overview of Project Functionality
This specific piece of the spreadsheet keeps track of cell dependencies, allowing variables 
and equations to be used from assignment 1.

# Comments to Evaluators:
This project primarily confused me with the relative ease of the methods, but the confusing
way that some of the documentation was written. I also had a very difficult time getting my 
testing set up, and caused a massive, program breaking bug at one point. 

# Assignment Specific
I predicted to spend 8 hours on this assignment. I spent about 8 hours total.
There was a relatively large amount of time (about 2 hours) where I fought with 
visual studio over a bug that occured when I incorrectly placed and deleted the testing file
inside of my main project. This caused a phantom error to occur in the deleted file, 
and required a reset and pull from github to fix. 

Another 2 hour block was purely spent on testing, with about 4 being the actual code portion.
